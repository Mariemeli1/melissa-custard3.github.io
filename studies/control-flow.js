 * 1. If statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
 * 2. Use else statements to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
 * 3. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
 * 4. Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
